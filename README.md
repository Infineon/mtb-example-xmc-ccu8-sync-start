# XMC MCU: CCU8 Timer Synchronous Start

This code example demonstrates the synchronous start of Capture-Compare Unit 8 (CCU80 and CCU81) in the XMC&trade; MCU upon receving a trigger from the Event Request Unit (ERU).

The CCU8 timer slice program blinks the on-board user LEDs (CCU80 blinks User LED1 and CCU81 blinks User LED2) when a timer period match interrupt occurs.

## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade; software](https://www.cypress.com/products/modustoolbox-software-environment) v2.3
- [SEGGER J-Link software](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack)
- Programming Language: C
- Associated Parts: All [XMC™ MCU](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/32-bit-industrial-microcontroller-based-on-arm-cortex-m/) parts

## Supported Toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm® Embedded Compiler v9.3.1 (`GCC_ARM`) - Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`

## Supported Kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [XMC1400 Boot Kit](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/kit_xmc14_boot_001/) (`KIT_XMC14_BOOT_001`) - Default value of `TARGET`
- [XMC4700 Relax Kit](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/kit_xmc47_relax_v1/) (`KIT_XMC47_RELAX_V1`)

## Hardware Setup

For the ERU trigger to start the timers, a falling edge is required, which are configured as follows:

1. The potentiometer on the XMC1400 Boot Kit connected to pin 2_5 is enabled.

2. For the XMC4700 Relax Kit, pin 1_15 is used. A negative falling edge can be introduced by having an external pull-up circuit powered by a 5-V source.

## Software Setup

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the Code Example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details open><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. Enter the local path in the **Application(s) Root Path** field to indicate where the application needs to be created.

   Applications that can share libraries can be placed in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details open><summary><b>In Command-line Interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool to easily create one or more ModusToolbox applications. See the "Project Creator Tools" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details.

Alternatively, you can manually create the application using the following steps:

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the **modus-shell** app from the Start menu.

   **Note:** The cloned application contains a default BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.mtb*) in the *deps* folder. Use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) (`make modlibs` command) to select and download a different BSP file, if required. If the selected kit does not have the required resources or is not [supported](#supported-kits-make-variable-target), the application may not work.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

Various CLI tools include a `-h` option that prints help information to the terminal screen about that tool. For more details, see the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details open><summary><b>In Third-party IDEs</b></summary>

**Note:** Only VS Code is supported.

1. Follow the instructions from the **In Command-line Interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

</details>

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using a micro-USB cable through the debug USB connector.

2. Program the board using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

   1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

   2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (JLink)**.

3. For the XMC1400 Boot Kit, rotate the potentiometer to introduce the ERU trigger. For the XMC4700 relax Kit, complete the external pull-up circuit, which introduces the negative edge required to trigger the ERU.

4. Once the triggers are introduced, user LEDs on the kit start blinking alternatively at approximately 2 Seconds.

5. The following waveforms indicate the synchronous start of the CCU8 timers.

  - LED1 is LOW and LED2 is HIGH as indicated the by the yellow and purple waveforms respectively.

<br>

   - LED1 and LED2 start blinking simultaneously as indicated by the yellow and purple waveforms.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (JLink)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and Implementation

This code example demonstrates the use of two Capture-Compare Unit 8 (CCU8) timers (CCU80 and CCU81) operating on their first slices starting synchronously when an event is registered by the Event Register Unit (ERU). A falling edge is used to register the event on the ERU.

On the XMC1400 Boot Kit, the on-board potentiometer (internally connected to the P2_5 pin) is used to register the event. To use this, the pin must be enabled in the *design.modus* file in *\COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS\TARGET_KIT_XMC14_BOOT_001* as follows:
